/* jobs.groovy

  This Groovy file contains the jenkins job DSL plugin code to build all the
  required views, folders, and jobs for a particular project in the Jenkins
  interface.

  The easiest way to debug or experiment with changes to this is:
    * check them in to a branch
    * trigger a build of that branch on the setup_ClusterHQ-flocker job
    * ssh into the master (same hostname as the web ui)
    * compare the master configuration xml with the branch configuration xml:

        BASE=/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ClusterHQ-flocker/jobs/
        A=master
        B=copy-artifacts-for-all-jobs-FLOC-3799
        for config in $(find ${BASE}/${A} -name config.xml | cut -d '/' -f 10- | sort); do
            if [ -e ${BASE}/${A}/${config} ] && [ -e ${BASE}/${B}/${config} ]; then
                diff -u ${BASE}/${A}/${config} <(sed -e "s,${B},${A}," ${BASE}/${B}/${config})
            fi
        done | less

      Certain changes will always be present.  For example, triggers for the
      cron-style jobs are only created for the master branch.

  The full Jenkins job DSL reference can be found on the URL below:
  https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Job-reference

  The file is consumed by the Jenkins job setup_ClusterHQ_Flocker. This file
  is read by a build step of type 'Process Job DSL' which produces all the
  jenkins objects.

  A typical jenkins job contains the following sections, this is just an
  example of possible actions within a particular section:

   * Environment variables:
        - These are used to pass environment variables to the build steps or
          any other step in the job.

   * Source Control defintions:
        - repository URL
        - what SCM tool git/svn/mercurial
        - operations to do prior/after a git update/close

    * Triggers:
        - When to execute the build ?
        - On a crontab style
        - by pooling the repository for changes
        - triggered by GitHub or others

   * Wrappers which 'decorate' the build steps of the job
        - adds stuff like timestamps to the log output
        - sets a timeout and aborts the build when exceeded

    * Build steps
        - Commonly shell based steps, as in the cli to execute

    * Post-Build actions also called Publishers:
        - Archiving produced files so that they are made available in other
          jobs
        - Running coverage or test reports
        - Triggering other jobs


    The structure of this file is as follows:

    A set of functions which implement the different sections of the job:

        - folder (creates a folder view in Jenkins to store the jobs)
        - wrappers
        - triggers
        - scm (sets the Source Control section)
        - publishers (set the post-build steps)
        - steps (consumes the contentes of the build.yaml build steps, and
            expands those as shell cli text'

    A full set of job blocks follows, these iterate over the build.yaml file for
    each job definition of a particular 'job_type' and create all the jobs
    related to that 'job_type':

        - run_trial
        - run_trial_for_storage_driver
        - run_sphinx
        - run_acceptance
        - run_client
        - omnibus

    Then we have the multijob block, which collects all the defined jobs based
    on 'job_type' and adds them to a 'multijob phase' that executes all the
    jobs in parallel.
    When a new 'job_type' is added to the configuration above, that job_type
    configuration should be added into the multijob block so that it gets run
    as part of the parallel execution phase.
    This multijob after executing the different jobs, collects all the produced
    artifacts (test reports, coverage reports) from the different jobs.
    So that a aggregated view of all the results is made available within the
    multijob details page for a completed job.

    The last section in this file defines cron style type jobs which are not
    executed as part of the main multijob.  These follow a similar structure to
    the common 'job_type' definitions above, except they include a trigger
    section specifying an daily schedulle.
